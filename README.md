Encore! is a 2D Shmup where the enemy is controlled by the Background music.

Enemy attacks are controlled by the background music of each level, with different types of music resulting in different attack patterns.

The attacks patterns are all generated automatically, only needing MIDI data and extracted musical features to create a boss's attacks.
